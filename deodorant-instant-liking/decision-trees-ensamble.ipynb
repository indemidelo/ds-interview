    "\n",
    "* **Simple to understand** and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "* Requires **little data preparation**. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that *this module does not support missing values*.\n",
    "* The **cost** of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "* Able to **handle** both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable.\n",
    "* Able to handle **multi-output problems**.\n",
    "* Uses a **white box model**. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "* Possible to **validate a model using statistical tests**. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "* Performs well even if its **assumptions are somewhat violated** by the true model from which the data were generated."

    "The disadvantages of decision trees include:\n",
    "* Decision-tree learners can create **over-complex trees** that do not generalise the data well. This is called **overfitting**. Mechanisms such as pruning, setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "* Decision trees can be **unstable** because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "* The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be **NP-complete** under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "* There are **concepts that are hard to learn** because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "* Decision tree learners create **biased trees if some classes dominate**. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree."

    "The core principle of *AdaBoost* is **to fit a sequence of weak learners** (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) **on repeatedly modified versions of the data**. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction. The data modifications at each so-called boosting iteration consist of applying weights $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_N$ to each of the training samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, those weights are all set to $w_i/N$, so that the first step simply trains a weak learner on the original data. For each successive iteration, the sample weights are individually modified and the learning algorithm is reapplied to the reweighted data. At a given step, those training examples that were incorrectly predicted by the boosted model induced at the previous step have their weights increased, whereas the weights are decreased for those that were predicted correctly. As iterations proceed, examples that are difficult to predict receive ever-increasing influence. Each subsequent weak learner is thereby forced to concentrate on the examples that are missed by the previous ones in the sequence."
