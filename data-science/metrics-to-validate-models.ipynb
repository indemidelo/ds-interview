    "The *PRESS* statistic (Predicted Residual Sum of Squares) is a form of *cross-validation* used in regression analysis to provide a summary measure of the fit of a model to a sample of observations that were not themselves used to estimate the model. It is calculated as the sums of squares of the prediction residuals for those observations. See also *Leave-one-out cross-validation*.\n",
